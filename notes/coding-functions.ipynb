    "<img src=\"images/pestle.png\" style=\"width:90px\" align=\"right\"> Years ago I learned to make Thai red curry paste from scratch, including roasting then grinding seeds and pounding stuff in a giant mortar and pestle. It takes forever and so I generally buy curry paste ready-made from the store. Similarly, most cookbooks provide a number of fundamental recipes, such as making sauces, that are used by other recipes. A cookbook is organized into a series of executable recipes, some of which \"invoke\" other recipes. To make dinner, I open a cookbook, acquire some raw ingredients, then execute one or more recipes, usually in a specific sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a program proceeds in the same way. Opening a cookbook is the same as importing libraries. Acquiring raw ingredients could mean loading data into the memory. The main program  invokes functions (recipes) to accomplish a particular task. As part of writing a program, we will typically break out logical sections of code into functions specific to our problem, whereas the functions in libraries tend to be broadly-applicable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way we organize our code is important. Programs quickly become an incomprehensible rats nest if we are not strict about style and organization. Here is the general structure of the Python programs we will write:\n",

    "The problem is that, now, `sum` only works on that global data. It's not generically useful. The clue is that the function ignores the `data` argument. So, technically the function can see global data, but it's not a good idea. (Violating this rule to alter a global variable is also a good way to get a subtle bug that's difficult to find.)"
