# Common lower-level programming patterns

As with natural language, we can combine basic sentence structures to form more complex sentences. In the programming world, that means **nesting** one operation in another. In this section, we'll explore a few of the interesting combinations.

## Nested loops

We sometimes need to repeat repeated instructions, which we call a *nested loop*. For example, the [recipe for risotto](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/85389/gourmet-mushroom-risotto/) we discussed earlier goes on to say:

> Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is *al dente*, about 15 to 20 minutes.

We are supposed to add broth until we run out of it, 1/2 cup at a time.  For each 1/2 cup we add, we are to stir until it is absorbed, which we expressed as a single loop previously. Making the recipe more precise, we might express the recipe operation like this using a nested loop:

*while there is more broth:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*add 1/2 cup broth to pot*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*while broth not absorbed:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*stir rice in pot*

We are wrapping our previous loop in an outer loop ("*while there is more broth*"). This code pops out from our loop template by identifying the two conditional expressions and the loop operations.

In the analytics world, nested loops are hugely important because we use them to process matrices, images, and tables of data.

### Processing matrices

Let's get started by summing the numbers in a 3x3 matrix:

Recall that, while we humans can look at the entire matrix at once, a computer examines each element one-by-one. Because this is not a one-dimensional data structure, we can't use a simple "for each element in the matrix" loop. The most common template for iterating through all elements of an *n* x *m* matrix looks like this:

*for i in 0..n-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for j in 0..m-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*do something with matrix<sub>i,j</sub>*

where *matrix<sub>i,j</sub>* accesses the element at row *i* and column *j*.  Such a nested loop gives all possible combinations of *i* and *j*, which is what we want when operating on a matrix. Consider the following use of that template to print out all of the two-dimensional indices:

*for i in 0..n-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for j in 0..m-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*print i,j*<br>

The output would be *n* * *m* lines of output so, for a 3x3 matrix, we would see:

```
0,0
0,1
0,2
1,0
1,1
1,2
2,0
2,1
2,2
```

Notice how the column *j* value varies more quickly than the row *i* value.  We can reverse this order of traversal by changing the loop order:

*for j in 0..m-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for i in 0..n-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*print i,j*<br>

With the *j* loop on the outside, it will vary less quickly than the inner *i* loop.

**Exercise**: Given a list of first names in a list of last names, of length *n* and *m*, write a nested loop pseudocode to print every combination of first and last name.

To sum all of the elements of a 3x3 matrix, we let *n*=3 and *m*=3 and use an addition operation:

*init sum to 0*<br>
*for i in 0..2:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for j in 0..2:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*add matrix<sub>i,j</sub> to sum*

You might recognize this as a 2D form of an accumulator operation.

As a more realistic example, let's add two matrices A and B together to form C. The key operation is to add A<sub>i,j</sub> to B<sub>i,j</sub> to get C<sub>i,j</sub>. Visually, it looks like this:

<img src=images/ABC.png width=360>

**Exercise**: Write out the pseudocode nested indexed loops to add two matrices together.

### Processing images

In the images project for this class, we will be doing lots of fun things to images. An image is nothing more than a two-dimensional matrix whose entries are pixel grayscale values from 0 to 255. A pixel value of 0 is black and 255 is white. For example, if we zoom in on an image, we see the individual elements (called pixels) of a two-dimensional matrix:

<img src=images/obama-zoom.png width=400>

The only difference between an image and a matrix is that we typically access the elements of an image using x and y coordinates, rather than row and column. The template for a nested loop that accesses each element of an image looks like this:

*for x in 0..width-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for y in 0..height-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*process pixel<sub>x,y</sub>*<br>

Because the *y* coordinate varies faster than the *x* coordinate, the inner loop traverses one vertical stripe. The outer loop shifts *x* to the next vertical stripe to the right.

**Exercise**: Write out the pseudocode to compute the average pixel value in an image.  Hint: This accumulator needs a running sum.

### Processing tables

Operating on a table is exactly like operating on a matrix, except that the elements are typically heterogeneous. For example, in the following table we can see dates, numbers, and strings of text.

<img src=images/rows.png width=700>

Instead of using indexes *i* and *j*, we typically use *row* and *col* to index into tables. The template for accessing each element of a table with n rows and m columns looks like this:

*for row in 0..n-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for col in 0..m-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*do something with table<sub>row,col</sub>*

Because it's customary to use *i* and *j* as loop indices, we might also process a table like this:

*for i in 0..n-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for j in 0..m-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*do something with table<sub>i,j</sub>*

Some think *i* and *j* make the loop more readable.

To sum a specific column requires just one loop because the column index is fixed. For example, to sum the second column (index 1), we could do this:

*init sum to 0*<br>
*for i in 0..n-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*add table<sub>i,1</sub> to sum*<br>

where *table<sub>i,1</sub>* gets the value at index 1 for a particular row of the table.

Another pattern uses nested for-each loops instead of indexed loops, which makes for very readable pseudocode:

*for each row in table:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for each col in row:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*do something with col value*


## Filtering sequences

One of the most common nested operations is a conditional inside of a loop. We use it to implement the [filter](operations.md#filter) operation, for example. The filter template looks like:

for each *x* in *sequence*:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if *condition*: add *x* to new list<br>

To convert a real-world filtering problem to pseudocode, your goal is to identify the *sequence* and the *condition* in that template. To filter out negative values (filter in nonnegative values) as we did in the rainfall problem, the *sequence* is the rainfall list and the *condition* is "*x >= 0*":

*for each x in rainfall*:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*if x>=0: add x to new list*<br>

Let's write pseudocode for a more complicated filtering problem, filtering for the list of Oscar winners:

<img src=images/filter-winners.png width=590>

*for each row in table:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*if row<sub>2</sub> is 1 add row to new table*

Notice how we test one column value from the row but add the entire row to the new table. If we just added the "winner" column value to the new list, we would end up with a list of ones: 1, 1, 1, ..., 1.

## Searching sequences

Instead of filtering a sequence, such as a list, we often just need to know if a particular element is present. We call this **searching** and a search typically returns the index of the found element. If the element is not found, the search returns invalid index -1.

The template for searching a sequence of length *n* for element *e* looks like the filter template except we don't collect the magic elements. Instead, we track the index that matches *e*:

*let index be -1*<br>
*for i in 0..n-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if *sequence<sub>i</sub>* = *e*: *index* = *i*

For example, recall the searching for 999 visualization from the [search operation](operations.md#search):

<img src=images/search-rainfall.png width=180>

We could implement that with the following pseudocode.
 
*let index be -1*<br>
*for i in 0..n-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*if sequence<sub>i</sub> = 999: index = i*

There is a subtlety here. This loop finds the **last index** because it keeps searching even after it finds *e*. In other words, if there are multiple *e* in the list, it sets *index* multiple times. Its final value is the index of the last *e*. What we want, however, is typically to find the **first index** so we need a way to bust out of that loop when we find the first match. In pseudocode, we say that a loop *breaks* out:

*let index be -1*<br>
*for i in 0..n-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*if sequence<sub>i</sub> = 999*:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*index = i*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*break out of loop*

Now, the loop will terminate early; just as soon as it finds the first *e*. We could also use a more generic loop to accomplish the same thing but without the explicit breakout.

*let index be 0*<br>
*while sequence<sub>i</sub> is not e and index<n*:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*let index be index + 1*

The only problem with this simpler loop is that the index is not -1 in the case that *e* is not found. Consequently, we need to deal with that case, which is when *index* = *n*, after the loop:

*let index be 0*<br>
*while sequence<sub>i</sub> is not e and index<n*:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*let index be index + 1*<br>
*if index==n: let index be -1* (*we fell off the end of sequence*)

**Exercise**: Alter one of the pseudocode loops so that it finds the last element not the first. Hint: you just have to change the loop conditions.

## Summary

By nesting one loop in another or nesting a conditional operation within the loop, we arrive at some extremely useful programming patterns.

When your real-world problem talks about "all combinations", you often need a loop that looks like:


*for i in 0..n-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for j in 0..m-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*process i,j*<br>

This technique easily extends to 3-dimensional data:

*for i in 0..n-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for j in 0..m-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for k in 0..p-1*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*process i,j,k*<br>

Nested loops are also what you need to walk the elements of a 2-dimensional data structure, such as a table, matrix, or image.

If you need to filter data, consider using a conditional inside of a loop:

for each *x* in *sequence*:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if *condition*: add *x* to new list<br>

The same construct can be used to search for the index of an element, *e*, by breaking out of the loop upon match (instead of adding to a new filtered list):

*let index be -1*<br>
*for i in 0..n-1:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if *sequence<sub>i</sub>* = *e*:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*index* = *i*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*break out*
