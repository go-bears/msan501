# Bash your way to victory

## Goals

* Launch a bash shell
* Set the working directory
* List the files in that directory
* Launch Python from the shell
* Print command-line arguments to a Python program

## Description

UNIX shell (`bash` in our case) is an interactive domain specific language used to control and monitor the UNIX operating system, which includes processes, devices, ram, cpus, disks etc. It is also a programming language, though weâ€™ll use it mostly to move files around, execute commands, etc. If you have to use a Windows machine, either install a UNIX shell, install Linux with VMWare, or launch a UNIX box and Amazon Web services.

You need to get comfortable on the UNIX command line because we will control all of the cloud computing facilities using the command line.

When you first start up the `Terminal.app` or launch a shell using whatever Linux app you have, you will see either a simple dollar prompt or something more complicated that displays the current directory or current machine etc:

```bash
$ 
```

The shell is just an interactive interpreter like we have with Python:

```python
>>> print "hello"
hello
>>>
```

To do the same thing in bash:

```bash
$ echo "hello"
hello
$
```

The shell has a number of state variables, one of which is the *current working directory*. Most commands that we execute will be relative to this working directory. You can print out the current working directory with command:

```bash
$ pwd
/Users/parrt/github/msan501/notes
$ 
```

After you execute a command by typing a command possibly with arguments and hitting return, you get the prompt back. It is ready for another command.

Any *path* starting with `/` means it is an absolute path starting at the root of the disk directory hierarchy. (You can learn more about [paths at wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#Unix_style)). So anything else is considered relative to the current working directory. For example, if your current working directory is `/Users/parrt/github/msan501` then `ls notes` will give you a directory listing of the `notes` directory underneath `/Users/parrt/github/msan501`. Here's a useful diagram showing the components of a fully qualified pathname to a file called `view.py`:

One of the most common things to do is to change the current working directory with `cd`:

```bash
$ cd /Users/parrt/github/msan501
$ pwd
/Users/parrt/github/msan501
$ 
```

You can ask for a list of the files in that directory:

```bash
$ ls
LICENSE      README.md    data/        labs/        notes/       projects/
```

Note that `~` is a special character that means "user's home directory".  On a Mac that is `/Users/YOURID` for whatever YOURID is. For me that is `/Users/parrt`.

There are lots of programs on the disk. You can launch them simply by using their name as the first element on a command line. For example, here's how we start a Python shell:

```bash
$ python
Python 2.7.12 |Anaconda 4.2.0 (x86_64)| (default, Jul  2 2016, 17:43:17) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.11.00)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> 
```

That of course gives us a new prompt, `>>>`, which is for Python. We can exit Python by hitting control-D (which means "end of file"). As we exit Python it will take us back to the shell and the `$` prompt.

Anything that follows the name of the command is considered an argument to that command. For example, here is how to get the directory listing for a specific directory even if we're not currently in that directory:

```bash
$ ls /bin
[*          csh*        echo*       ksh*        mkdir*      rcp*        stty*       wait4path*
bash*       date*       ed*         launchctl*  mv*         rm*         sync*       zsh*
cat*        dd*         expr*       link*       pax*        rmdir*      tcsh*
chmod*      df*         hostname*   ln*         ps*         sh*         test*
cp*         domainname* kill*       ls*         pwd*        sleep*      unlink*
```

The notation is generally:

*command arg1 arg2 arg3*

That is analogous to the following function call in Python:

*command(arg1, arg2, arg3)*
 
As another example, here is how we execute a specific Python script rather than entering interactive Python mode:

```bash
$ python myscript.py
... any output from the script ...
```

Naturally, we often want to pass arguments to the Python script itself. These arguments simply follow the script name given to the `python` command. For example, here is a simple script that, which prints any arguments to the script (let's put it into `args.py`):

```python
import sysprint "args:", sys.argv[1]
```

We run that script like this:
 
```bash
$ python args.py hi mom
args: ['args.py', 'hi', 'mom']
$ 
```
