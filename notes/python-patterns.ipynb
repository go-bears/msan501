    "# Programming Patterns in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've got a basic vocabulary and sentence structure for Python, let's look at a few implementations for the [high-level programming patterns](operations.md), such as Map, Filter, Combine, etc... Each of those patterns has a pseudocode implementation using conditional and loop patterns, which we can translate very easily to python syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we go through, you will see that program design and coding are a game of word association. A high-level operation, such as map, should trigger a pseudocode loop template in your mind, which should then trigger a for-each Python code template.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Keep in mind that we design programs by selecting and applying patterns, not specific code sequences. Coding is the final act in the design process where we get an executable document.* So, think visually about how you would manipulate lists of data or extract information from data. I often draw things out or put them into a spreadsheet to help me visualize. Manually moving some data around on paper helps me to understand the operations to perform.  After designing a sequence or combination of high-level patterns, we write things out in pseudocode so we don't have to worry early on about Python syntax details. After we're happy with the pseudocode, we finally convert that to Python programming language syntax. Fortunately, there is a very close relationship between pseudocode and Python code. As you gain more experience, it will be easier to go straight from the pattern to the code, but we still design programs using patterns, not code, in our head. For complex problems, I still write out pseudocode, despite 35+ years coding experience."
